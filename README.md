## Encryption&TemplateMatching Project
For the first part(the encryption), the objective was to encrypt and
decrypt an image by using a non-chaos based image encryption
scheme. It consist in a pixel substitution algorithm that uses a
secret external key. The second part(pattern recognition), is a project that focuses on the character recognition by using an
template matching algorithm.
## Proiect1_POO
  Various operations applied to a circular linked list using OOP concepts.
## Proiect2_POO
  #### Treasure Hunt Game in C++
This project is created to highlight the following principles of OOP: class inherintance, abstraction of data and behavior, polymorphism
and virtual metods. The game consist in a map which there are 3
treasures and 4 seekers. The seekers are placed in each corner of
the map. Each player make only one move per round and he cannot step on someone else's square. At the final of every round, it will be displayed the position and the status of every player. The game
ends when there are no more squares to be explored or the players either cannot move or they found the treasures already.

## Proiect3_POO
Implemented a manual Multiset with all specific operations.

## Romanian sub-dialect identification
The task is to train a model on tweets in order to build a model for a
in-genre binary classification by dialect task, in which a classification model is required to discriminate between the Moldavian and the Romanian dialects. I used model classifiers such as Multinomial
Naive Bayes, Complement Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine. After hyperparameter optimization with grid search methods I applied a voting function between them.

## OnlineReservationApp
Java application for seat reservation at different shows such as: theater plays, opera or stand-ups shows. I implemented other functionalities for finding shows by hour, date, name, make/delete an account, client login, add/update/delete shows with posibility to store the data in a database or in CSV files. A GUI for users is available as well. 

## Web Development

C# and .NET technologies are used to create a trip reservation web application. There are implemented all relationships between tables(one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) and CRUD for every model. Authentication is available as well. Only the Admin can add, edit and delete trips, only Bookers can book places on trips, edit or delete their reservations and unauthenticated users can only see the trips available.
