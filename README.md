## Encryption&TemplateMatching Project
For the first part(the encryption), the objective was to encrypt and
decrypt an image by using a non-chaos based image encryption
scheme. It consist in a pixel substitution algorithm that uses a
secret external key. The second part(pattern recognition), is a project that focuses on the character recognition by using an
template matching algorithm.
## Proiect1_POO
  Various operations applied to a circular linked list using OOP concepts.
## Proiect2_POO
  #### Treasure Hunt Game in C++
This project is created to highlight the following principles of OOP: class inherintance, abstraction of data and behavior, polymorphism
and virtual metods. The game consist in a map which there are 3
treasures and 4 seekers. The seekers are placed in each corner of
the map. Each player make only one move per round and he cannot step on someone else's square. At the final of every round, it will be displayed the position and the status of every player. The game
ends when there are no more squares to be explored or the players either cannot move or they found the treasures already.

## Proiect3_POO
Implemented a manual Multiset with all specific operations.
